	<h2>Author and Retired Human Rights Lawyer</h2>
	<br>
	<p>After Cambridge, Stephen Jakobi began a career in industry. His strong belief in justice led him to become a solicitor, working in private practice. In 1992 he founded the Human Rights organisation Fair Trials International and was adviser to the European institutions on subjects ranging from Guant namo to the European arrest warrant. He was awarded an OBE in 2005. Now retired, Stephen lives with his wife in London.
